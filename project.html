					Automated vehicles (AVs) have great market potential and are envisioned to be one of the dominating travel modes. Currently, future travel demand and land use are forecasted by integrating land use models and travel demand models. However, the advent of AVs will both change the interaction between the models and also impact the parameters and variables involved in other related models such as location choice models. Therefore, the goal of our project is to identify the potential effects of AVs on the models and figure out how to adjust the models so that planning doesn't go astray.
